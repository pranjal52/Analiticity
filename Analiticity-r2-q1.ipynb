    "'''In statistics,régression linéaire a.k.a linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X.In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression was the first type of regression to be used extensively in practical applications.This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters and because the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.\n",

    "Here Air Quality data of a particular location on a hourly basis for 1 year has been given. Build a linear regression model for this data with T(temperature) as the goal field and all other attributes as independent variables.Then find the sum total of all the positive coefficients in the model.Let it comes out to be 'X'. Finally enter your output as floor(X)\n",
